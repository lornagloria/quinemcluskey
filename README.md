### PROJECT TITLE:
Quine-McCluskey Boolean Minimization.

## DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to implement the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, a widely used method for simplifying Boolean expressions. 
The program is designed to accept minterms as input and produce a simplified Boolean expression in the form of a sum of products.

## INSTALLATION:
1. Ensure that an appropriate Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is installed for executing the program. Suggested IDEs include:  
   - Code::Blocks  
   - DEV C++  
   - Embarcadero DEV C++  
   - Visual Studio Code (ensure the C extension is installed).  
   
2. Open the project file using any of the IDEs listed above.

## USAGE:
1. Within the chosen IDE, utilize the compile and run functionality to execute the program.  
2. Prior to running the program, some IDEs, such as DEV C++, may prompt you with a new window requesting permission to mark the program as read-write. 
It is essential to select "YES" to ensure smooth execution.  
3. When inputting minterms, press "Enter" after each digit to register your input.  
4. It is crucial to enter the minterms accurately, as any alteration in digits will directly affect the resulting simplified expression.  
5. After the program generates the minimized function in the sum of products format, you may encounter redundancies in the output.
 A one-time simplification may be necessary, but this should be relatively straightforward to identify.
